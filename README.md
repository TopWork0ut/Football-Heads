# Football & Heads

My first game from school, which was developed in 2019

The essence of the game: you have to shoot the keys Q (first player) and BACKSPACE (second player) and hit the enemy. Each time you hit your opponent, the arrow accelerates by 5, but if you hit the ball, the arrow accelerates by 1. The winner is the one, who kills his opponent, if he will have 0 lives.

Keys:
1) a w s d q e
2) arrows ( up, down, right, left), space and backspace.
